Problem Set 4: 
This is a group assignment with 2-4 people per group.

For each group member, find a data source with an API--here is the Public API page Links to an external site. I linked to in class, there are other lists, I am sure. Each group member can pick their own API and there is no need that it be Biology related, though should be appropriate. Each group member should pick a different API.

Yuanming: API of eBird: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59
Stephanie: API of COVID-19: https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API

For each API, write a script (or Jupyter Notebook) to retrieve information using that API and select part of that to save/print/graph/display in a useful/interesting manner. Again the information retrieved is up to you, though you must do more than print the entire returned value.

So, one API per group member, use Python to interact with the API, do something with the returned data beyond just printing the whole raw return.

Submit as a link to a public github repository. Assuming peer review worked for Problem Set 3, we will do this again for this problem set. I hope in addition to reviewing each other's code you will see more examples of working APIs and what can be done using them.
